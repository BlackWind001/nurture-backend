## Nurture Backend

This repository hosts the backend of an app called Nurture.

Nurture allows couples to improve their relationships by understanding their problems and allowing them to work on various skills in order to ultimately have a fulfilling relationship.

### ToDo

In the backend we currently need to implement the following:
1. Authentication (prebuilt auth solution works for now)
2. When 2 people are in a relationship, we want to map their accounts to a single relationship. So, we will need a DB/table for relationships. Also, we currently do not know what is present in the relationship people (other than the people ids) so maybe it should be a NoSQL database.
